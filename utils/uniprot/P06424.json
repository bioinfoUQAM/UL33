Induces host cell cycle arrest at the G2 phase by associating with and preventing the nuclear entry of host CDK1/cyclin B1 complexes. Inhibits cellular DNA replication by preventing loading of host replication licensing proteins MCM2 and MCM7 onto chromatin. Within the cytoplasm, associates with host kinase SRPK1, a splicing factor regulator, and inhibits its activity. Therefore, E4 favors expression of late viral transcripts by inhibiting SRPK1-mediated phosphorylation of host serine-arginine (SR) proteins that have critical roles in mRNA metabolism. Late in the infectious cycle, E4 also acts to diminish the integrity of the keratinocyte by disrupting the keratin cytoskeleton and inducing apoptosis through alteration of mitochondrial function to facilitate egress of the newly formed virions"}],"commentType":"FUNCTION"},{"texts":[{"evidences":[{"evidenceCode":"ECO:0000250","source":"UniProtKB","id":"P06922"}],"value":"Assembles into oligomeric complexes.
