They inhibit IFN-alpha/beta induced tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT2. Blocking the IFN-alpha/beta pathway requires binding to STAT1 in the cytoplasm. They inhibit IFN-gamma induced serine phosphorylation of STAT1. Block the IFN-gamma pathway by binding to and stabilizing the parallel form of the STAT1 dimer, further inducing high-molecular-weight complex formation and inhibition of transcription by IFN-gamma. May also have a role in preventing the cell to enter apoptosis. Modulate regulation of viral transcription and replication. Overexpression inhibits the viral RNA polymerase. The absence of all C', C and Y2 proteins leads to viral delayed growth. Plays an important role in virion particles release.
