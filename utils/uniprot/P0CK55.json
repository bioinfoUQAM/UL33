Participates in the final step of tegumentation and envelope acquisition within the host cytoplasm by directly interacting with the capsid. Upon virion binding to target cell, a signaling cascade is triggered to disrupt the interaction with the capsid, thereby preparing capsid uncoating. Activates the AP-1 pathway and enhances EBV reactivation and virus release. Inhibits type I IFN-induced TYK2, STAT1 and STAT3 phosphorylation, thereby impairing type I IFN signaling and counteracting the ability of IFN-alpha to suppress the reactivation of EBV. Recruits SHP1 phosphatase to dephosphorylate STAT1. Mediates STAT2 ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. Also suppresses type II and type III IFN signaling. Contributes to G1/S arrest in the host cell. Acts as an miRNA regulator that interferes with the function of RISC in miRNA-mediated mRNA silencing. As a result, SUMOylation is increased. When encapsulated in the exosomes released by EBV-infected host cells, may facilitate the infection in recipient cells"}],"commentType":"FUNCTION"},{"texts":[{"evidences":[{"evidenceCode":"ECO:0000255","source":"HAMAP-Rule","id":"MF_04039"}],"value":"Homodimer.
