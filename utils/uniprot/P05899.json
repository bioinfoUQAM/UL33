Forms a complex with host APOBEC3G thus preventing the entry of this lethally hypermutating enzyme into progeny virions. Functions as an adapter molecule, recruiting APOBEC3G to the ubiquitin-proteasome machinery. Targets APOBEC3G for degradation through the assembly with elongin BC complex, CUL5 and RBX1. Binds viral RNA and affects the stability of viral nucleoprotein core. May play a role in viral morphology. Interacts with host ABCE1, which seems to be involved in lentiviruses capsid formation and displays RNase L inhibitor activity. This interaction may play a role in protecting viral RNA from damage during viral assembly. May interact with host SAT, which is a regulator of polyamine cell level. This interaction may be relevant since polyamines affect viral RNA properties (By similarity)"}],"commentType":"FUNCTION"},{"texts":[{"evidences":[{"evidenceCode":"ECO:0000250"}],"value":"Homomultimer; in vitro and presumably in vivo.
