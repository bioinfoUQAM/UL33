Diverts host MHC-I molecules to the trans-Golgi network-associated endosomal compartments by an endocytic pathway to finally target them for degradation. MHC-I down-regulation may involve AP-1 (clathrin adapter protein complex 1) or possibly Src family kinase-ZAP70/Syk-PI3K cascade recruited by PACS2. In consequence infected cells are masked for immune recognition by cytotoxic T-lymphocytes. Decreasing the number of immune receptors also prevents reinfection by more HIV particles (superinfection). Down-regulates host SERINC3 and SERINC5 thereby excluding these proteins from the viral particles. Virion infectivity is drastically higher when SERINC3 or SERINC5 are excluded from the viral envelope, because these host antiviral proteins impair the membrane fusion event necessary for subsequent virion penetration"}],"commentType":"FUNCTION"},{"texts":[{"evidences":[{"evidenceCode":"ECO:0000255","source":"HAMAP-Rule","id":"MF_04078"}],"value":"Bypasses host T-cell signaling by inducing a transcriptional program nearly identical to that of anti-CD3 cell activation.
