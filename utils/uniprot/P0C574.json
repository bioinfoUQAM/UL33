Promotes alteration of mitochondrial morphology, dissipation of mitochondrial membrane potential, and cell death. Alternatively, inhibits the production of interferon in the infected cell at the level of host mitochondrial antiviral signaling MAVS. Its level of expression differs greatly depending on which cell type is infected, in a manner that is independent of the levels of expression of other viral proteins. Monocytic cells are more affected than epithelial cells. Seems to disable virus-infected monocytes or other host innate immune cells. During early stage of infection, predisposes the mitochondria to permeability transition through interaction with host SLC25A6/ANT3 and VDAC1. These proteins participate in the formation of the permeability transition pore complex (PTPC) responsible of the release of mitochondrial products that triggers apoptosis"}],"commentType":"FUNCTION"},{"texts":[{"evidences":[{"evidenceCode":"ECO:0000255","source":"HAMAP-Rule","id":"MF_04064"}],"value":"Oligomer.
