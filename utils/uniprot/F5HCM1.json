Expression of IE1 and IE2 proteins is critical for the establishment of lytic infection and reactivation from viral latency (By similarity). Disrupts PML-associated ND10 nuclear bodies by interfering with host PML and SP100 sumoylation thereby altering the regulation of type I and type II interferon-induced gene expression (By similarity). Promotes efficient viral growth by interacting with and directing host SP100 to degradation, leading to enhanced acetylation level of histones (By similarity). In addition, functions in counteracting the host innate antiviral response (By similarity). Inhibits the type I interferon pathway by directly interacting with and sequestrating host STAT2 (By similarity). Also targets type II interferon pathway by repressing IL6- and STAT3 target genes (By similarity). Repression of STAT3 genes is due to STAT3 nuclear accumulation and disruption of IL6-induced STAT3 phosphorylation by IE1 (By similarity). This repression is followed by phosphorylation and activation of STAT1 (By similarity). Inhibits host ISG transcription by sequestering host ISGF3 in a PML- and STAT2- binding dependent manner (By similarity). Alters host cell cycle progression, probably through its interaction with host E2F1 or RB1 that overcomes the RB1-mediated repression of E2F-responsive promoters (By similarity)"}],"commentType":"FUNCTION"},{"texts":[{"evidences":[{"evidenceCode":"ECO:0000250","source":"UniProtKB","id":"P03169"},{"evidenceCode":"ECO:0000250","source":"UniProtKB","id":"P13202"}],"value":"Forms homodimers (By similarity).

Interacts with host STAT3; this interaction leads to STAT3 nuclear accumulation and disruption of IL6-induced STAT3 phosphorylation.
