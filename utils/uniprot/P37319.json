Plays essential roles in viral nuclear egress to mediate capsid transit across the nuclear membrane (By similarity). Facilitates nuclear egress cooperatively with host C1QBP and protein kinase C/PKC to induce lamin A/C phosphorylation and subsequent reorganization (By similarity). In turn, lamina disassembles and nuclear egress occurs. Recruits the serine/threonine protein phosphatase PPP1CA/PP1-alpha to dephosphorylate the translation initiation factor EIF2S1/eIF-2alpha, thereby couteracting the host shutoff of protein synthesis involving double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase EIF2AK2/PKR (By similarity). In turn, controls host IRF3 activation and subsequently inhibits host interferon response (By similarity). Controls the DNA sensing pathway by interacting with and inhibiting host STING/TMEM173. Also down-modulates the host MHC class II proteins cell surface expression (By similarity). Acts as a neurovirulence factor that has a profound effect on the growth of the virus in central nervous system tissue, by interacting with host BECN1 and thereby antagonizing the host autophagy response (By similarity)"}],"commentType":"FUNCTION"},{"texts":[{"evidences":[{"evidenceCode":"ECO:0000250","source":"UniProtKB","id":"P36313"}],"value":"Interacts with host PPP1CA to form a high-molecular-weight complex that dephosphorylates EIF2S1/eIF-2alpha.
