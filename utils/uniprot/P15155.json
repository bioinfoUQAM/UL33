Rotavirus attachment and entry into the host cell probably involves multiple sequential contacts between the outer capsid proteins VP4 and VP7, and the cell receptors. It is subsequently lost, together with VP7, following virus entry into the host cell. Following entry into the host cell, low intracellular or intravesicular Ca(2+) concentration probably causes the calcium-stabilized VP7 trimers to dissociate from the virion. This step is probably necessary for the membrane-disrupting entry step and the release of VP4, which is locked onto the virion by VP7"}],"commentType":"FUNCTION","molecule":"Outer capsid protein VP4"},{"texts":[{"evidences":[{"evidenceCode":"ECO:0000305"}],"value":"Forms the spike 'foot' and 'body' and acts as a membrane permeabilization protein that mediates release of viral particles from endosomal compartments into the cytoplasm.

The priming trypsin cleavage triggers its rearrangement into rigid spikes with approximate two-fold symmetry of their protruding parts.
