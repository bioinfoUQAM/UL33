They inhibit IFN-alpha/beta induced tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT2. Blocking the IFN-alpha/beta pathway requires binding to STAT1 in the cytoplasm. They inhibit IFN-gamma induced serine phosphorylation of STAT1. Block the IFN-gamma pathway by binding to and stabilizing the parallel form of the STAT1 dimer, further inducing high-molecular-weight complex formation and inhibition of transcription by IFN-gamma (By similarity). May also have a role in preventing the cell to enter apoptosis. Modulate regulation of viral transcription and replication. Overexpression inhibits the viral RNA polymerase. The absence of all C', C, Y1 and Y2 proteins leads to viral delayed growth. Plays an important role in virion particles release.
