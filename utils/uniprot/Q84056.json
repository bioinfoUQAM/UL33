This results in the accumulation of unprocessed 3' end pre-mRNAs which can't be exported from the nucleus. Cellular protein synthesis is thereby shut off very early after virus infection. Viral protein synthesis is not affected by the inhibition of the cellular 3' end processing machinery because the poly(A) tails of viral mRNAs are produced by the viral polymerase through a stuttering mechanism. Prevents the establishment of the cellular antiviral state by inhibiting TRIM25-mediated RIGI ubiquitination, which normally triggers the antiviral transduction signal that leads to the activation of type I IFN genes by transcription factors IRF3 and IRF7. Also binds poly(A) and U6 snRNA. Inhibits the integrated stress response (ISR) in the infected cell by blocking dsRNA binding by EIF2AK2/PKR and further phosphorylation of EIF2S1/EIF-2ALPHA. Stress granule formation is thus inhibited, which allows protein synthesis and viral replication"}],"commentType":"FUNCTION"},{"texts":[{"evidences":[{"evidenceCode":"ECO:0000250"}],"value":"Homodimer.
