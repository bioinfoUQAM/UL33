Acts cooperatively with NS2 to repress activation and nuclear translocation of host IFN-regulatory factor IRF3. Also disrupts the association of IRF3 with CREBBP. Interacts with host mitochondrial-associated membrane (MAM) MAVS and prevents the interaction with RIGI. Interacts with TRIM25 to suppress TRIM25-mediated RIGI ubiquitination and thereby RIGI-MAVS interaction. Together with NS2, participates in the proteasomal degradation of host STAT2, IRF3, IRF7, TBK1 and RIGI through a NS-degradasome involving CUL2 and Elongin-C. The degradasome requires an intact mitochondrial MAVS. Decreases the levels of host TRAF3 and IKBKE/IKK-epsilon. As functions other than disruptions of the type I IFN-mediated antiviral signaling pathways, induces host SOCS1 and SOCS3 expression. Suppresses premature apoptosis by an NF-kappa-B-dependent, interferon-independent mechanism and thus facilitates virus growth. Additionally, NS1 may serve some inhibitory role in viral transcription and RNA replication. Suppresses proliferation and activation of host CD103+ CD8+ cytotoxic T-lymphocytes and Th17 helper T-lymphocytes"}],"commentType":"FUNCTION"},{"texts":[{"evidences":[{"evidenceCode":"ECO:0000250","source":"UniProtKB","id":"P0DOE9"}],"value":"Monomer. Homomultimer. Heteromultimer with NS2. Interacts with the matrix protein M. Interacts with host ELOC and CUL2; this interaction allows NS1 to form an active E3 ligase with ELOC and CUL2. Interacts with host IRF3; this interaction leads to the disrupted association of IRF3 with CREBBP and thus reduced binding of IRF3 to the IFN-beta promoter. Interacts with host MAVS; this interaction prevents MAVS binding to RIGI and inhibits signaling pathway leading to interferon production. Interacts with host MAP1B/microtubule-associated protein 1B.
